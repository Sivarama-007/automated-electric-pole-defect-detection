# Automated Defect Detection System for Electric Poles ⚡

This project implements an automated image-based defect detection system for electric poles using a Roboflow-trained object detection model. The system performs inference on input images and visualizes detected defects using bounding boxes and confidence scores.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Manual inspection of electric poles is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the inspection process by identifying visible defects in electric poles using computer vision techniques.

The system takes an input image of an electric pole, sends it to a trained object detection model, and displays detected defects along with their confidence scores.
